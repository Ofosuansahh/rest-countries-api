# Rest Countries API with filtering features Project

## A fully functional project written to show how to create a Rest API and manipulate the result.

This is a project built along with a Typescript and React course to show how to create a functional react application using REST APIs. This project has  the following features:

* Toggle theme betweeen darkmode and lightmode using react useState Hook
* Display result per initiated parameters using a Fetch call
* Realtime search of a country using country name
* Filter list of Countries being displayed by Region
* Allow for more information about a country by clicking on the country card
* Allow for more information about a neighbouring country by clicking on the neighbouring country name on the more details page
* Finally an Error Boundary that displays information about an input error and provides a way to recover back to the homepage from the error

## Issues with the project

current issues include an inept way of displaying the cardList.
